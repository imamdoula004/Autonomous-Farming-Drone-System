# Autonomous-Farming-Drone-System
An experimental simulation of an **AI-powered agricultural drone platform** for precision farming.   This project models how an autonomous farming drone could **scan fields, detect crops, monitor soil health, drop seeds/fertilizers, and generate 3D analysis images** using an intelligent matrix-based geolocation system.
