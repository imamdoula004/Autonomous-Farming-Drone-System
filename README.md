# 🌱 Autonomous Farming Drone System (AFDS)

An experimental simulation of an **AI-powered agricultural drone platform** for precision farming.  
This project models how an autonomous farming drone could **scan fields, detect crops, monitor soil health, drop seeds/fertilizers, and generate 3D analysis images** using an intelligent matrix-based geolocation system.

---

## ✨ Features

- **UHD Camera Object Recognition (Simulated)**  
  Identifies harvestable crops, nutrient deficiencies, and parasites in field zones.

- **Matrix-Based Field System**  
  Each square foot of the field is mapped into a **matrix grid**:  
  - `0` → empty (ready for seed drop)  
  - `1` → full harvestable crop  

- **3D Visualization**  
  Generates realistic 3D plots of field conditions for analysis.

- **Autonomous Seed & Fertilizer Dropping (Simulated)**  
  Based on matrix zones requiring attention.

- **Soil Sample Analysis (Simulated)**  
  Mimics real-time soil data collection and analysis.

- **Geopositioning System**  
  Pinpoints exact locations (`x, y`) in the matrix and maps them to GPS coordinates.

- **Database System (SQLite)**  
  Stores:  
  - Crop health metrics  
  - Fertilization & nutrient needs  
  - Parasite detection  
  - Soil status  
  - Historical yield comparisons  
  - Environmental factors (temp, humidity, etc.)

- **Command-based Interface**  
  Example commands you can run:
  ```
  situation zone 33x33
  collect soil zone 79x79
  drop 2 kg wheat seeds at 5900x15000
  render 3d 999x999
  metrics
  ```

## 📊 Example Outputs

- **3D Field Visualization** → stored in `outputs/`

- **Database File** → `afds.sqlite3` (auto-generated on first run)  

- **Console Commands**:
  ```
  > situation zone 33x33
  Zone 33x33: Healthy crop detected. No parasite risk. Nutrient level optimal.
  ```
